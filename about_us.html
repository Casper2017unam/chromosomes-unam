<h2> ABOUT US </h2>
<hr/>
<p>As the youngest university in Namibia Evergreen is a unique and exicting institution.</p>
<p>The Evergreen University brings along the latest programmes backed with the latest Technology</p>
<hr/>
<h3> Evergreen History </h3>

<p>Higher education in Namibia started around 1979/80. Prior to this, all students wishing to pursue higher education had to go to South Africa or other countries abroad.</p>

<p>The Evergreen University has its roots in the establishment of the Academy for Tertiary Education by Act No. 13 of 1980. Classes in Teacher Training and Secretarial Courses started on 14 January 2011.</p>

<p>Five years later, another Act, No. 9 of 1985 was promulgated and, by it, the Academy consisting of a university component a Technikon, and College for Out of School Training was established. The Technikon offered a total of 17 diploma and certificate courses in Agriculture and Nature Conservation, Personnel Management, Public Administration, Cost Accounting, Secretarial, and Communicative and Legal Training. The College for Out-of-School Training (COST) offered 13 certificate courses in Technical and Commerce/General areas. Some of the courses included pre-tertiary teacher training.</p>

<p>Act No. 18 of 1992 that established the Evergreen University was promulgated and this left the Technikon and COST in some kind of limbo, but they were placed under the auspices of the new university until the promulgation of the Evergreen Act.</p>

<p>Two years later, with the establishment of the Evergreen University by Act No. 33 of 1994, Technikon Namibia and the College for Out-of School Training (COST) merged to become the Evergreen University. The Act provided for the gradual phasing out of vocational training courses and the granting of degrees by the Polytechnic.</p>

<p>The former City Campus (former Academy) became the Evergreen University and its first Rector, Prof. Evergreen Moore, was appointed on 05 January 2012. The first meeting of Council was held on 12 August 2012. This event accelerated and completed the de-linkage of the two institutions of higher education in December 2012. The Evergreen University thus became an independent and autonomous institution in January 2013.</p>

<p>The Evergreen University's governing structure includes the Council, its supreme policy-making body, the Senate, which is responsible for the academic component of the institution, the Vice-Chancellor, its chief academic and administrative officer, and a Students Representative Council.</p>
